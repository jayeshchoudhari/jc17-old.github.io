<strong> Interests </strong>
<br>
There are number of things I am curious about, but currently, my research focus is Algorithms for large data, Social Networks, and Parameterized Algorithms. In particular, I am working in understanding the dynamics of information diffusion in social networks, estimating some basic properties of large graph efficiently, and parameterized algorithms for some hard graph problems.
